# Weather App Using OpenWeatherMapAPI

It will currently calculate the temp from kelvin to fahrenheit and let you know if its rainy or cloudy.  There is lots I can do with this and it will be a continued project.

## Current Ideas
- [ ] Let use decide between Kelvin, Fahrenheit and others
- [ ] Use graphics to help determine if its going to be cloudy or rainy
- [ ] Currently it is using city names but they recommend city id.  Need to figure a way to utalize this as the id's are huge!
- [ ] Currently only works with america
- [ ] Get the weekly forecast
